-My Name is Matt Caruso and I'm a Senior studying Computer Science at Roger Williams University.
-Currently my team and I are building an Augmented Reality application for the Microsoft Hololens 2.
-The application uses machine learning to look for NFPA Diamonds in a lab setting and display related safety information about that specific material.
